Culture Cow
===========

<a href="http://hubot.github.com/">Hubot</a> configuration for Khan Academy's
Culture Cow

What it means to be Culture Cow
====================

1) Culture Cow provides a steady drip of Khan Academy culture, straight into
HipChat's veins.

2) If at any point Culture Cow acts like an annoying robot by decreasing the
signal:noise ratio in our HipChat rooms, it will be turned into delicious
hamburgers.

Can I add more culture magic?
=============================

Absolutely. Modify scripts/culture.js (or whatever else you want). Just abide
by the two rules of Culture Cow above. And sorry it's JS and not all
cool'n'CoffeeScripty.

Setup instructions
==================

1) Clone repo

2) Install dependencies: ```npm install``` (or [start here](https://github.com/github/hubot/tree/master/docs) if having trouble.)

3) Start the culture cow: ```bin/culturecow```
