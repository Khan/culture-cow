Rules of Culture Cow
====================

1) Provide a steady drip of Khan Academy culture, straight into HipChat's
veins.

2) If at any point the Culture Cow acts as an annoying robot by decreasing the
signal:noise ratio in our HipChat rooms, it will be turned into delicious
hamburgers.

Setup instructions
==================

1) Clone repo
2) Install dependencies: ```npm install```
3) Start the culture cow: ```bin/culturecow```
